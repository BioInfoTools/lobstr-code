lobSTR wish list... some day these features will be added

- make allelotyper part of the c++ program
- deal with paired end reads (might incorporate stitching, need to get rid of duplicate read pairs in genotyping step)
- consensus sequence at genotyping stage
- add conversion automatically in allelotype program
- move indexer to c++

Done:
*- deal properly with indels in the flanking region to return accurate cigar scores. This currently can affect the STR region length and cigar score.
*- (along with above) return exact boundaries of the STR region
*- output alignment scores (maybe after local realignment)
