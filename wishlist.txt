lobSTR wish list... some day these features will be added

- ability to call more than 2 alleles at loci (such as DYS464) with multiple copies
- improved remove duplicates algorithm
- ability to easily compare lobSTR results to capillary electrophoresis callsets
- consensus sequence at genotyping stage
