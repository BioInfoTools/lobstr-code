lobSTR wish list... some day these features will be added

- fix alignment CIGAR Scores around ends of reads with mismatches
- deal with paired end reads (might incorporate stitching, need to get rid of duplicate read pairs in genotyping step)
- consensus sequence at genotyping stage
- quality control metrics
