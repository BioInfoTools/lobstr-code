I. INSTALLATION
 
To install, download lobstr (which you must have gotten that far if you're reading this README file...). Navigate to the directory where it was installed. Then do:

tar -xzvf lobstr-xxx.tar.gz
cd lobstr-xxx/
./configure
make
make install

The last step might require root access in order to have proper permissions. Congratulations, if these steps didn't explode with error messages, you're done. If not, it is probably because you're missing required packages. See section IV for requirements.

II. USAGE

To see usage instructions, just type:

lobSTR --help

for a list of all command line options.

NOTE: THE GENOME BUILD OF THE GENOME FILE MUST MATCH THE COORDINATES OF THE STR TABLE. All files included in this download assume hg18 coordinates.

Genome files for entire genomes or individual chromosomes are available at 
http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/downloads.html
