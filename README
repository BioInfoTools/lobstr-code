I. INSTALLATION
 
To install, download lobstr (which you must have gotten that far if you're reading this README file...). Navigate to the directory where it was installed. Then do:

tar -xzvf lobstr-xxx.tar.gz
cd lobstr-xxx/
./configure
make
make install

The last step might require root access in order to have proper permissions. Congratulations, if these steps didn't explode with error messages, you're done. If not, it is probably because you're missing required packages. See section IV for requirements.

II. USAGE

To see usage instructions, just type:

lobSTR --help

for a list of all command line options.

NOTE: All files included in this download assume hg18 coordinates.

Required inputs are:
* -f: comma separated list of files containing raw reads in fasta or fastq format (for fastq you must add the argument -q)
* -o: prefix to name all output files
* --index: path and prefix of lobSTR index: The lobSTR download comes with a precompiled STR index (hg18), in lobstr-xxx/index/. To specify this as the index, use:
--index-prefix lobstr-xxx/index/lobSTR_

change the path accordingly to match the path where the index is stored
