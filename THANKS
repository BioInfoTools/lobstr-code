In addition, STRANGERS uses several portions of code from external projects:

- strmat, a C package for working with suffix trees created by Dan Gusfield (www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~gusfield/strmat.html)
- a wrapper around several strmat classes written by Danny Yoo (https://hkn.eecs.berkely.edu/~dyoo/python/suffix_trees/)
